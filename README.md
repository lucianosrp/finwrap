- üí± Automatic currency conversion with real-time rates
- üîÑ Transaction data normalization
- üè¶ Multi-account aggregation
- üöÄ Built on Polars for high performance
- üì¶ Easy configuration via YAML

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lucianosrp/finwrap.git
```

## Quick Start

```python
from finwrap import Account, AccountCollection, Currency

# Define a single account
checking = Account(
    name="Checking",
    file_path="transactions.csv",
    date_col="Date",
    transaction_col="Description",
    amount_col="Amount",
    date_col_format="%Y-%m-%d",
    currency=Currency(
        currency_col="Currency",
        convert_to="USD",
        strategy="latest"
    )
)

# Create a collection of accounts (if you have more than one)
accounts = AccountCollection(
    accounts=[checking, investements]
)

# Get normalized transaction data
df = accounts.get_data().collect()
```

## Configuration via YAML

You can define your accounts in YAML:

```yaml
accounts:
  - name: Checking
    file_path: transactions.csv
    date_col: Date
    transaction_col: Description
    amount_col: Amount
    date_col_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
    currency:
      currency_col: Currency
      convert_to: USD
      strategy: latest
```

Load it with:

```python
accounts = AccountCollection.load("accounts.yaml")
```

## Features in Detail

### Currency Conversion

Finwrap supports automatic currency conversion using real-time exchange rates:

```python
currency = Currency(
    currency_col="Currency",  # Column containing currency codes
    convert_to="USD",         # Target currency
    strategy="dynamic",       # "dynamic" or "latest"
    default_rate=None        # Optional fallback rate
)
```

### Supported File Formats

- CSV (.csv)
- Parquet (.parquet)
- Excel (.xlsx, .xls)

### Transaction Cleaning

Clean transaction descriptions with regex:

```python
account = Account(
    # ... other parameters ...
    transaction_col_cleaning_regex=r"[0-9]+"  # Remove numbers from descriptions
)
```

### Export to Bagels

Finwrap can export your transaction data to [Bagels](https://github.com/EnhancedJax/Bagels) - Powerful expense tracker that lives in your terminal.
```python
from finwrap.export.bagels import save_to_bagel

# Export a single account or account collection
save_to_bagel(accounts)
```

This will:
- Create accounts if they don't exist
- Import transactions while avoiding duplicates
- Automatically categorize imported transactions (They will be marked as imported)

Note: Bagels must be installed and configured on your system for this feature to work.

### CLI for Bagels Export

You can also export transactions to Bagels directly from the command line:

```bash
bagels-export accounts.yaml
```

This will process all accounts defined in your YAML file and export them to Bagels.
